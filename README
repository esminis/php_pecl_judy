1. INTRODUCTION
-----------------

php-judy is an extension by Nicolas Brousse for the Judy C library.
  -> http://pecl.php.net/package/Judy
  -> http://github.com/orieg/php-judy

Structures available in the PHP Judy extension :
 - BITSET (using Judy1)
 - INT_TO_INT (using JudyL)
 - INT_TO_MIXED (using JudyL)
 - STRING_TO_INT (using JudySL)
 - STRING_TO_MIXED (using JudySL)

A Judy array is a complex but very fast associative array data structure for
storing and looking up values using integer or string keys. Unlike normal
arrays, Judy arrays may be sparse; that is, they may have large ranges of
unassigned indices.

  -> http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Judy_array

The PHP extension is base on the Judy C library that implements a dynamic array.
A Judy array consumes memory only when populated yet can grow to take advantage
of all available memory.  Judy's key benefits are:  scalability, performance,
memory efficiency, and ease of use. Judy arrays are designed to grow without
tuning into the peta-element range, scaling near O(log-base-256) -- 1 more RAM
access at 256 X population.
